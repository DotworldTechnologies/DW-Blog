Cybercrime becomes the most dangerous and costly attacks that estimate over $500 billion a year. These attacks cause danger to all types of businesses, domains, and markets.

Blockchain/Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is based on the secured and trust transaction that is inherently decentralized in nature making it a true technology for Cyber Security. It has its hands on everything from Medical and Financial data sharing to encrypted messaging. It is an open pass along transaction for the members of the blockchain but all are encrypted and secured.

In a Blockchain, two parties can make all their transactions (maybe money, credentials, smart contracts, etc...). It creates an unbreakable wall of security access between a hacker and your information. Transparent data are up with password-free entry while the private data are up with an uncrackable form of entry including retina scans and fingerprints. A decentralized form of storage makes the small block to appear like a large puzzle to crack, which makes the data more secure. Let’s see some sectors which use blockchain.

#### Cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrency in simple terms is digital cash. It’s similar to regular money like ₹₹ or $$ — but it’s digital-only, so there are no bills or coins to carry around.

According to Wikipedia, a cryptocurrency is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses strong cryptography to secure financial transactions, control the creation of additional units, and verify the transfer of assets. The decentralized control of each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain. 
Cryptocurrencies have the potential to make the world better by letting any two people in the world exchange money directly, without involving a financial institution or government. This will mean more equality of opportunity for those without access to traditional financial services, like bank accounts and credit cards.

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency first introduced on October 31, 2008, with a computer science paper that described how it would work. A few months later, on January 3, 2009, the code was released and the first bitcoins appeared

Also, in November, Instagram was affected by a bug which led to a [data breach](https://www.cpomagazine.com/cyber-security/instagram-breach-exposes-personal-data-of-49-million-users/). Users who updated the platform changes and used the new platform discovered that their passwords were showing in the URL of their web browsers. Affected users were cautioned to change their passwords and delete browser history. But at least 49 million users' data was leaked to the internet because of unprotected AWS servers connected to the internet. The leak was discovered on May 20, 2019. The AWS Server belonged to a Mumbai based marketing company Chtrbox which has been unprotected roughly for 72 hours. This Instagram breach is yet another in a long list of AWS databases connected to the internet without proper security.
